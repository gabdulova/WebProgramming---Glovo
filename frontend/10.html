                    <h2>What is Glovo?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Glovo is an application thanks to which you can order the delivery of the best products in your city in a matter of minutes. Just tell us what you need and we will deliver it wherever you are. <br>
                        What products can I order? Food, smoothies, hot lunch from your favorite restaurant... You can even ask us to bring a charger or keys... <br>
                        Make a wish and we will deliver you anything in your city in a matter of minutes. <br>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>How do I place an order?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Placing your first order is incredibly easy. Follow these instructions: <br>
    
                    (1) Open the "Manage Payment Methods" section in your profile and add a debit/credit card. <br>
                    (2) Go to the home screen and enter the delivery address. Select the correct city from the drop-down list. <br>
                    If you have a promo code, don't forget to add it before placing an order. <br>
                    <br>
                    Now you have 3 options: <br>
                    (1) Order delivery from a restaurant or store: You can choose one of our partners in any category. <br>
                    (2) Send anything: Just specify the pick-up and delivery points. <br>
                    (3) Order "anything": specify what you need, and Glovo couriers will do everything possible to deliver you the right thing! <br>
                    As soon as you place an order using the instructions above, the Glovo courier will accept your order and deliver it in a matter of minutes. <br>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>How much does the delivery cost?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The cost of our services depends on the distance — the shorter the distance our couriers cover, the lower the cost of delivery. <br>
                        <br>
                        For Glovo orders of the "Courier" and "Whatever" categories, the application calculates the delivery cost based on the distance between the receiving point and the delivery address and shows only the total cost of delivery. <br>
                        For Glovo orders of the "Anything" category, you will see the total amount to be paid after the courier purchases the ordered goods. <br>
                        <br>
                        If you place an order at one of the establishments available in our app, you will see the cost of your order before it is confirmed. The cost of delivery depends on our agreement with the institution where you place the order — to find out the cost of delivery, click on the icon of the institution. This way, you will know the total amount to be paid until the order is confirmed. <br>
                        In some cases, the actual cost of the products may differ from that indicated in the application. If the difference is less than 30%, the Glovo courier will automatically complete the purchase of products. Information about the actual price will be indicated on the purchase receipt loaded by the courier. <br>
                        However, if the price difference is more than 30%, the courier will contact you and clarify whether you agree to make a purchase. (In case of overnight delivery, an additional service fee is added to the cost of each ordered product. Its size depends on the city and the institution. The exact amount of the fee is indicated on the payment page in the application.) <br>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>I want to return the product. What should I do?</h2>
                    <p>
                        We transfer your orders to couriers who make purchases on your behalf. Thus, you are both the buyer and the end user of the product. You should send refund requests and complaints about the product directly to the institution (if you used our platform to order McDonald's products from the drop-down list, contact Glovo directly).
                    </p>

                    <h2>When will my order be delivered to me?</h2>
                    <p>If a courier has already been assigned to your order, you can monitor its movement in real time and contact him in case of any questions. If a courier has not yet been assigned for your order, your order will remain in the system in the status of waiting for distribution. If we expect long delays, a yellow message will be displayed at the top of the application. An order for which a courier has not yet been assigned can be canceled for free.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Incomplete order or incorrect products</h2>
                    <p>If an incomplete order or incorrect products have been delivered to you, go to your profile in the app and click "Help". We will contact you and solve the problem as soon as possible. <br>
                        <br>
                        The order was delivered in an improper condition <br>
                        If the order is delivered to you in an improper condition, go to your profile in the application and click "Help". We will contact you and solve the problem as soon as possible. <br>
                        </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>What types of bank cards do you accept?</h2>
                    <p>We accept Visa, MasterCard and American Express cards</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>What payment methods can I use?</h2>
                    <p>Globo supports different payment methods in different countries. When placing an order, you will see which payment methods are available in your country, and you will be able to choose a payment method that is convenient for you from the drop-down menu. In case of payment by card, we accept credit and debit cards, including Visa, Mastercard and American Express cards. In case of cash payment, we accept payment only in local currency.</p>

                    <h2>What does the commission for services mean?</h2>
                    <p>The service fee is the fee for our service, which we add to the cost of the product.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Do I need to tip?</h2>
                    <p>It's up to you! If, in your opinion, the courier deserved money "for tea", then why not? We allow couriers to receive (but forbid asking for) money "for tea".</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>How do I check my promo code/balance information?</h2>
                    <p>If you have received a bonus in the form of free shipping or credit and want to check your balance or find out how to use the bonus, go to the "Promo Codes" section in your profile. By default, the promo code is applied to your next Glovo order. Bonuses that were not used when placing one order will be applied to your next order. <br>
                        If you have received a special promo code* from an institution or as part of an advertising campaign, you can add it on the same profile page ("Promo Codes"). The added promo code will be automatically applied to your next order. <br>
                        *Please note that special conditions may apply for special promo codes. Also, promo codes can only be valid for a limited period of time. <br>
